  The most frustrating day of the week...
  The on/off hook switch of the RTT56B isn't working (or did he never worked correctly?)

What is wrong with my RTT56B? Sometimes the on/off hook switch is always on-hook, sometimes it's always off-hook, and sometimes it just works fine.

I tried a lot of things to fix the problem... but everything I checked seems to be working fine. So the only thing left to do is clean the contacts of the leaf switch; hopefully, this will fix the problem. But during the day, I had some little panics:

1. Oxidized wires
The sides of my wires are oxidized, which means they are not conductive anymore around the sides. If the wires oxidize more and become oxidized on the inside, I will have to replace them...

I tried to do it with one, but that wasn't a great idea. The soldering is so old that the outside of it is oxidized as well. Heating it with the soldering iron didn't work, I just couldn't get the contacts desoldered. But since my phone works every now and then, and the inside of the cables didn't look oxidized, I decided not to change the cables after all.

2. A broken hook?
Could the hook be broken? Since I have two phones, I could easily switch the hook between them. By placing the hook of the non-working phone on the other phone, the working phone kept working. Conclusion: the hook is not broken.

3. Oxidized contacts?
Could the contacts be oxidized? I cleaned the contacts of the leaf switch with a little piece of paper, and after a while, it looked like it worked again. But then it stopped working again... Hopefully, it will work for real with a decent contact cleaner.
