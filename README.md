# (Dis)connect
> **"Sometimes we need to downgrade our technology to upgrade our connections."** >

(Dis)connect is an interactive installation created for a 5-week passion project. It uses two vintage rotary phones to facilitate a private, 2-minute conversation between two strangers in separate spaces.

## The Concept
This installation aims to break the "smartphone bubble" by using obsolete technology to facilitate meaningful micro-interactions.

- **The Interaction:**<br> Two rotary phones are placed in different locations.

- **The Trigger:**<br> When a user dials a number on either phone, the other phone begins to ring.

- **The Connection:**<br> Once picked up, a voice-over icebreaker introduces a prompt, allowing two strangers to share a private, unrecorded 2-minute moment.

## Directories
- **arduino:** Hardware source code. Organized into iterative scripts that showcase the project's evolution and various prototyping stages.
- **blog:** Source files for the project documentation website.

## Tech Stack

## Planning
### Week 1 (5 - 11 jan)
**How does the telephone work? Create a basis setup.**
- Are the phones working
- How can I call with it?
- Are the bells working?
- Can I connect the two phones?
- Can I send music from an arduino to the phone(s)?

### Week 2 (12 - 18 jan)
**Make the final hardware setup**
- Create a user flow. -> Tuesday
- Sound & talking circuit -> Tuesday
    - Is the whole sound circuit working?
    - Check what's wrong if two sounds are playing at the same time.
    - Where is the noise coming from during the talking status?
- Check if the phone is off hook. -> Tuesday/Wednesday
- Voice mails -> Wednesday
    - Can I make a voice mail?
    - Can I play a voice mail?
- The dail -> Thursday
    - How does it work?
    - Detect which number is dialed
- The bells -> Friday
    - Connect them to the circuit
    - Let  the bells ring at the right moments

### Week 3 (19 - 25 jan)
**Write the software**
- [ ] 

### Week 4 (26 - 1 feb)
**Scenografie + test the installation**
- Solder everything together
- Make a nice scenografie
- Test the installation

### Week 5 (2 - 8 feb)
**Create presentation + final touches**
- Create a presentation
- Final touches

### Week 6 (9 - 15 feb)
**Presentation**
- Create a presentation
