# (Dis)connect
> **"Sometimes we need to downgrade our technology to upgrade our connections."** >

(Dis)connect is an interactive installation created for a 5-week passion project. It uses two vintage rotary phones to facilitate a private, 2-minute conversation between two strangers in separate spaces.

## The Concept
This installation aims to break the "smartphone bubble" by using obsolete technology to facilitate meaningful micro-interactions.

- **The Interaction:**<br> Two rotary phones are placed in different locations.

- **The Trigger:**<br> When a user dials a number on either phone, the other phone begins to ring.

- **The Connection:**<br> Once picked up, a voice-over icebreaker introduces a prompt, allowing two strangers to share a private, unrecorded 2-minute moment.
